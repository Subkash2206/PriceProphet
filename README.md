# ðŸ”® PriceProphet: A Stock Direction Prediction Tool

PriceProphet is a command-line tool that uses machine learning to forecast the future direction of a stock's price. By analyzing historical data and a blend of technical indicators, it provides a data-driven signal on whether a stock is likely to move **UP** or **DOWN** over a specified period.

This project is built for learning, experimenting, and as a starting point for more complex quantitative analysis.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Powerful CLI:** Run predictions and specify parameters directly from your terminal.
* **Flexible Timeframes:** Predict price direction for the next **day, week, month,** or **year**.
* **Adjustable Prediction Bias:** Fine-tune the model's "optimism" by adjusting the `up_bias_ratio` to make it more or less likely to predict an UP signal.
* **Automated Feature Engineering:** Automatically calculates and uses a mix of indicators:
    * **Short-Term Momentum:** RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD, and EMAs (50 & 200-day).
    * **Long-Term Momentum:** Yearly Return, Yearly Volatility, and the stock's price distance from its 200-day EMA.
* **Dynamic Data:** Fetches the most up-to-date daily stock data from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`) every time it runs.
